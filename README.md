### Data Scientist in India
Iâ€™m a Data Engineer living in Bangalore, India. I am a fan of programming, design, and technology. I'm really fascinated by the research and projects happening in Data Science Space.

I officially became a Data scientist in 2014 later became well conversant with Azure and Python and was amazed with what all insights can be captured from data.
